## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS

### What I learned

Since that this is my first project on Frontend Mentor, a good chunk of the things I have learned have been about getting familiar with Frontend Mentor's project submission process. 

I learned about how to create a new GitHub Repository, as well as how to fill out the README template. 

As for design, I found out close to the end that I should have been following the image examples given when the window extended to their full height on the screen. Also, I learned that I need to size the parent element to its full height on the screen in order for its flex items to center properly.

I also was figuring out how margin and padding of different elements affect their placement.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on easier ways to size items, as I have probably spent the most time doing this.

I also was having trouble with sizing the div that contains the h1 and h2.
